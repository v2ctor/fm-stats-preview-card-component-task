## Author's comment

I really don't like the way my solution looks. I know I could've done it better, but I don't want to get hung up on fixing tiny mistakes and end up burning myself out over a flawed solution. I consider it my small failure and move on.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- BEM
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that you can (and should) wrap blocks into blocks instead of making elements of elements. 

### Continued development

  I want to continue on mastering the adaptive layout.
